              "Carlos, Your work is impeccable, and continues to look as it did the day you finished it. It accommodates all of my dogs needs as well as us humans. The little dog gates you designed and implemented are perfect and we receive compliments on them, I'll take no credit for them. You are a resource for ideas for me as I lack creativity and desire to put a lot of effort in deciding what I want. You help so much with that, from type/color of bricks for the backyard patio to what type of replacement tree for my beloved sick front yard tree. As always when you do a job at my house, I know I will have a true professional that I am dealing with. Any future clients can feel free to call me for references."

               "Carlos was great to work with from conception to completing the project! He listened to our ideas and brought them to life! Carlos was onsite everyday, took us to places to pick out stones and plants, and kept us updated with the progress along the way. He went above and beyond to make us happy and ensure our satisfaction. Carlos and his crew were very professional! All of our neighbors commented on how nice his crew was and how they kept it safe and clean when they were done for the day. We are so happy we selected OC Artistic Landscape for our project...it turned out better than expected and it's now the crown jewel of the neighborhood!"

              "We asked Carlos to help us with a project and were so impressed by his quality of work and professionalism that we expanded the project three-fold. In the initial phase of the project, we had three construction companies on-site, each in charge of a component of the project. However, we only moved forward in the later phases of the project with Carlos and his crew. We couldn't be happier with the outcome! We have since recommended Carlos and his crew to all our OC family and friends â€“ many of whom have used Carlos for their landscaping projects."
